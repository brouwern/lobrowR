<h2>Tags versus categories</h2>

<p>“I would say that categories are the general classification of an article, while tags are a grab-bag of ephemeral keywords that people might search through. Sections, on the other hand, are a there-can-be-only-one organizational tool that affects the URL and determines things like which RSS feed an article appears in”</p>
<p>but " ‘tags’ and ‘categories’ are simply possible names for your taxonomies that have no inherent functional difference in Hugo - i.e. they’re both just lists of stuff that could be called anything. This is potentially confusing especially for people coming from Wordpress where ‘tags’ and ‘categories’ do have a specific meanings and different functionality. Categories being potentially hierarchical and only available on posts where tags are available on both posts and pages and are typically used in a more ad-hoc ‘folksonomy’ manner."</p>
