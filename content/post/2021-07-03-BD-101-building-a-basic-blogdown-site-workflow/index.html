<p>I initially set this blog up via the GUI interface and instructions on Nick Strayer’s blog post the (tuftesque Hugo theme)[<a href="https://livefreeordichotomize.com/2017/07/13/introducing-the-tuftesque-blogdown-theme/" class="uri">https://livefreeordichotomize.com/2017/07/13/introducing-the-tuftesque-blogdown-theme/</a>] and Dan Quintana’s on the <a href="https://www.dsquintana.blog/free-website-in-r-easy/">Academic Hugo theme</a>. I broke my initial set up and had to troubleshoot some things. The workflow below ended up working</p>
<div id="uninstall-hugo" class="section level2">
<h2>Uninstall Hugo</h2>
<p>As always, when things stop working its good to uninstall and re-install things. I doubt this was contributing to the problem. Uninstalling Hugo took a few Google searches. From the command line according to (this)[<a href="https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown/issues/324" class="uri">https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown/issues/324</a>]</p>
<pre class="r"><code>brew remove hugo</code></pre>
<p>Hugo can show up a few places so I double checked these locations as per the post linked above:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>~/Library/Application\ Support/Hugo/
/usr/local/Cellar/hugo
/usr/local/bin/hugo </code></pre>
</div>
<div id="install-hugo" class="section level2">
<h2>Install Hugo</h2>
<p>I then re-installed Hugo</p>
<pre class="r"><code>blogdown::install_hugo(version=&quot;latest&quot;, force=TRUE)</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="create-site" class="section level2">
<h2>Create site</h2>
<p>Re-install stuff didn’t help, so I started rebuilding the site. I then had problems with the RStudio’s GUI interface for creating a blogdown site, so I did it with the code below. Note that I started with the default lithium theme, which I then install tuftesque over (below).</p>
<pre class="r"><code>blogdown::new_site(
  dir = &quot;~/Box Sync/R/lobrowr&quot;, # need to set directory to be made
  install_hugo = TRUE,
  format = &quot;toml&quot;,
  sample = TRUE,
  theme = &quot;yihui/hugo-lithium&quot;, # use original theme
  hostname = &quot;github.com&quot;,
  theme_example = TRUE,
  empty_dirs = FALSE,
  to_yaml = TRUE,
  serve = interactive()
)</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="set-directory-with-site-as-package" class="section level2">
<h2>Set directory with site as package</h2>
<p>I then defined the folder containing the blog as an R project. (This is done automatically when the RStudio GUI is used, but again, that was giving me issue).</p>
<pre class="r"><code>usethis::create_project(
  path = &quot;~/Box Sync/R/lobrowr&quot;,
  rstudio = rstudioapi::isAvailable(),
  open = rlang::is_interactive()
)</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="stop-serving-the-preview-site-to-prevent-hiccups" class="section level2">
<h2>Stop serving the preview site to prevent hiccups</h2>
<p>I’m currently working on a Mac. Previously – and on a PC – I had lots of issues with the preview site generated by RStudio. I’m having no such problems now, but stopping the sever can’t hurt.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>blogdown::stop_server()</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="install-the-tuftesque-theme" class="section level2">
<h2>Install the tuftesque theme</h2>
<p>A new theme can be install using install_theme(). One of the issues I had with using the RStudio GUI to generate the new blog was that I was getting an error related to having installed the tuftesque theme before. force = TRUE re-installs it over top of an existing installation. (Not sure why there was a problem with this i the first place).</p>
<pre class="r"><code>blogdown::install_theme(&#39;nstrayer/tuftesque&#39;,
                        force = TRUE)</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="preview-again---hurray---new-theme-now-implemented" class="section level2">
<h2>Preview again - hurray - new theme now implemented!</h2>
<p>I don’t know what’s going on under the hood, but installing tuftesque causes it to be used as the theme for the blog rather than the default lithium. THere’s no need to declare which theme to use.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>blogdown:::preview_site(startup = TRUE)</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="set-up-hugo-page-bundles" class="section level2">
<h2>Set up Hugo page bundles</h2>
<p><strong>Hugo page bundles</strong> make keeping things organized easy. I followed the advice from Allison Hill from (here)[<a href="https://alison.rbind.io/post/2019-02-21-hugo-page-bundles/" class="uri">https://alison.rbind.io/post/2019-02-21-hugo-page-bundles/</a>] and edited the R profile.</p>
<p>A project-specific R profile can be created like this:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>usethis::edit_r_profile(scope = &quot;project&quot;)</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="associate-with-git" class="section level2">
<h2>Associate with git</h2>
<p>The RStudio GUI for creating a new blog doesn’t allow you to set up Git or associate with GitHub. I followed Jenny Bryan’s instructions from (here)[<a href="https://happygitwithr.com/existing-github-last.html" class="uri">https://happygitwithr.com/existing-github-last.html</a>] and did this by hand. The command to set its just</p>
<pre class="r"><code>usethis::use_git()</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="link-with-github" class="section level2">
<h2>Link with GitHub</h2>
<p>To associate with GitHub I used the command line:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>git remote add origin https://github.com/brouwern/lobrowr.git
git push --set-upstream origin master</code></pre>
</div>
