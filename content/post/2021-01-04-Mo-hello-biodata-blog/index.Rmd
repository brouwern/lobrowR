Welcome to the **biodata blog**.  I've been teaching R, statistics for biologists, and computational biology for several years now, accumulating a mound of erratically organized handouts, datasets and exercises.  **biodata** is an attempt to compile and make this material accessible in a single place.  

I'm starting off the blog by taking chapters from an "R for biologists" lab manual I've worked on and releasing the lessons.  Most material in the blog is oriented towards those just beginning their journeys with R, data science, and statistics, but I'll include more advanced topics on bioinformatics,computational biology, the analysis of complex datasets.

If you have any comments or questions please leave a message in the threads, or contact me at brouwern@gmail.com.
