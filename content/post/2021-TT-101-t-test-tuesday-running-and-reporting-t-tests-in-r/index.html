<p>This basic post will walk through how to carry out a paired t-test in R and report the results.</p>
<div id="create-dataframe" class="section level2">
<h2>Create dataframe</h2>
<p>We’ll use some data from a paper by Faaborg et al on bird populations in Puerto Rico. We’ll look at 9 species of warblers, and compare the number of birds captured in mist nests in 1991 and in 2005 to determine if on average birds are declining at this study site</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#make a vector of species names.
species &lt;- c(&quot;OVEN&quot;,&quot;WEWA&quot;,&quot;NOWA&quot;,
             &quot;BWWA&quot;,&quot;HOWA&quot;,&quot;AMRE&quot;,
             &quot;CMWA&quot;,&quot;NOPA&quot;,&quot;PRWA&quot;)

#Number of birds of each species captured in 1991 
N.1991 &lt;- c(29, 6, 4, 60, 8, 19, 9, 7, 4)
N.2005 &lt;- c(24, 5, 0, 16, 3, 9, 2, 5, 8)

#make dataframe
dat &lt;- data.frame(species,
                  N.1991,
                  N.2005)</code></pre>
<p>Take alook at the dataframe; we have 3 columns, one with the names of the 9 species, one with the number caught in 1991, and one with the nubmer caught in 2005</p>
<pre class="r"><code>head(dat)</code></pre>

<h2>Paired t-test</h2>
<p>Its a bit confusing, but there are multiple ways to do a paired t-test in R. (I can think about about 6, will focus on the 2 easiest ones). Paired t-tests are actually just a 1-sample t-test where the “1 sample” is a set of differnces between pairs of data points. Each one of our species has a pair of data points: abundance in 1991 and abundance in 2005. We can give R the raw data and t.test will calcaulte the differnce on the fly, or we can calculate the difference ourselvres. If we let R calcualte the difference, we <strong>must</strong> tell it that we are looking for a paired t-test by telling it “paired = TRUE”. If we calcualte the difference ourselvees we <strong>must</strong> tell it we want a 1-sample t-test, which is done by giving it a mean value against which to test the null hypothesis (“mu = 0”).</p>
<div id="paired-t-test-version-1" class="section level3">
<h3>Paired t-test, Version 1</h3>
<p>Paired t-test carried out by giving the t.test() function 2 columns from from a dataframe.</p>
<ul>
<li>Note there is no “~”, just the name of each column, followed by a comma</li>
<li>must include paired = TRUE</li>
</ul>
<pre class="r"><code>t.test(dat$N.1991,    #column 1, then a comma
       dat$N.2005,    #column 2; 
       paired = TRUE)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## 
##  Paired t-test
## 
## data:  dat$N.1991 and dat$N.2005
## t = 1.7644, df = 8, p-value = 0.1157
## alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0
## 95 percent confidence interval:

<h3>Paired t-test, Version 2</h3>
<p>Paired t-test as a 1-sample t-test on the <em>difference</em> between two columns.</p>
<ul>
<li>First calcualte the difference between the columns</li>
<li>T-test is given one column</li>
<li>Note there is no “~”, just the name of the column that has the differnces</li>
<li>must set mu = 0</li>
<li>there is NO “paired = TRUE”</li>

<h2>Reporting the results of a paired t-test</h2>
<p>When we report a paired t-test we should give the p-value, the t statistic, and the degrees of freedom (df). NOte that for a paired t-test the df are equal to n-1, where n is the number of pairs in the data set (eg, the number of differences calculated), <em>not</em> the total number of seperate datapoinots.</p>
<p>We shoudl also report the effect size, which for a paried t-test is mean difference between the pairs; we should also report the 95% confidence interval for the effect size. Here, the mean difference is 8.2, which means on average there were 8 fewer individuals of each species captured in 2005 versus 1991. The 95 CI around this difference is large, from -2.5 to 19. Since it contains 0.0, the p value is greater than 0.05.</p>
<p>I would report the results of the t-test like this:</p>
<p>“There was a marginally significant difference in the number of birds of the 9 species captured in 1991 versus 2005 (paired t-test: t = 1.76, df = 8, p = 0.12). The mean difference in the number captured between years was 8.2 birds (95%CI: -2.5 to 19).”</p>
