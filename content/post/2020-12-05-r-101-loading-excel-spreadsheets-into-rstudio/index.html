<p>re-save as .csv and load</p>
<p>load directly</p>
<p>In this walk through we first re-save this data in an R-compatible format, a “csv” file, called “Lab1_data_PA_eagles.csv”.</p>

<p>Save the file “Lab1_data_PA_eagles.xlsx” to your computers desktop. Today we will be using this as the “working directory”</p>

<h4>Re-Save The Excel file as a “csv” file</h4>
<p>In Excel, follow these steps</p>
<ul>
<li>“File”</li>
<li>“Save As”</li>
<li>“Browse”</li>
<li>Select the working directory (your desktop)</li>
<li>Select “Save as type”</li>
<li>Select “CSV (Comma delimited)”</li>
<li>Click “Save”</li>
</ul>
<p>The data is now in a format that can be loaded into R.</p>

<h2>Preparing a file for loading into R</h2>
<p>Things work best when your Excel file is “clean” &amp; only has exactly what you want in it. Any extra, accidental typing can cause problems or make things confusing. A good practice is to always highlight cells to the right of and below your data, right click &amp; select “Delete”. This will remove any accidental typing that occurred.
Do this to the cells below your data also.</p>

<div id="reload-data" class="section level2">
<h2>Reload data</h2>
<p>Reload data; be sure to include the “csv” at the end. Use this code “eaglesPA &lt;- read.csv(file =”eaglesPA.xlsx“)”. NOTE: I changed the name of the file to include "_w_2_states" so that I wouldn’t overwrite the original file. Don’t use this code unless you changed the file name to the exact same thing</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#Use this code, w/o the &quot;#&quot; in front of it
# eaglesPA &lt;- read.csv(file = &quot;eaglesPA.xlsx&quot;)

#NOTE: I changed the name of the file to include &quot;_w_2_states&quot; so that I wouldn&#39;t overwrite the origina file.  Don&#39;t use this code unless you changed the file name to the exact smame thing
#eaglesPA &lt;- read.csv(file = &quot;./data/Lab1_data_PA_eaglesPA_w_2_states.csv&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Type ls() to see what is now in your workspace</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ls()</code></pre>
<pre><code>## character(0)</code></pre>
<p>Look at the re-loaded eaglesPA data object</p>
<pre class="r"><code>summary(eaglesPA)
dim(eaglesPA)
head(eaglesPA)
tail(eaglesPA)</code></pre>
