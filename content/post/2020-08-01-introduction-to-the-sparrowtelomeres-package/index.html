<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This package contains 3 things</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>A replication of stastical results in Meillere et al (2015) Traffic noise exposure affects telomere length in nestling house sparrows. Bilogy Letters 11: 20150559. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1098/rsbl.2015.0559" class="uri">https://doi.org/10.1098/rsbl.2015.0559</a></li>
<li>Readings and exercises based on Meillere et al. (2015) designed for introductory biology courses. Some of these use a reduced dataset to simplify analyses.</li>
<li>Examples of data visualization techinques using the data from Meillere et al. (2015)</li>
</ol>

<h2>Key files</h2>
<p>TODO: pre-recitation exercise</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Data preparation: Access data from origianl sources, prepare data for analysis, and save data within the sparrowtelomeres package as .csv and .RData files.</li>
<li>Replication: Replication of all statistical results and graphs in the original paper. All original results replicate, with minor variations due to how p-values are calculated.</li>
<li>Abridged &amp; annotated version of Meillere et al (2015): I have re-formatted, abridged, and annotated the original paper to make it more accessible to0 first-year biology undergraduates. Changes made are summarized below.</li>
<li>Pre-recitation exercise: In progress</li>
<li>Recitation exercise (with key): An exercise using data from the paper to teach students about data visualization, data interpretation and confidence intervals.</li>
<li>Post-recitation exercise: An exercise based on the abridged version of the paper to be completed after the recitation.</li>
<li>Beeswarm plot handout: 1-page presentation of the raw data, means and confidence intervals from the paper as a “beeswarm” plot (<a href="https://www.r-statistics.com/2011/03/beeswarm-boxplot-and-plotting-it-with-r/" class="uri">https://www.r-statistics.com/2011/03/beeswarm-boxplot-and-plotting-it-with-r/</a>)</li>
<li>Boxplot handout: 1-page presentation of the data as boxplots.</li>
<li>Errorplot handout: 1-page presentation of the means and confidence intervals of the data.</li>
<li>4-plot handout: 1-page presenation of the data in different formats (scatterplot, boxplot, etc).</li>

<div id="abridged-annotated-version-of-meillere-et-al-2015" class="section level2">
<h2>Abridged &amp; Annotated Version of Meillere et al (2015)</h2>
<p>The following types of chagnes were made to the abridged and annotated version of the paper:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Overall the paper was shortened, techincal terms removed or annotated with definitions, and techncial language simplified.</li>
<li>The abstract was converted to a structured formated with numbered bullets, which studies have shown increases comprehension.</li>
<li>Added keywords</li>
<li>Simplified the presentation of the methods</li>
<li>Created a subset of the data which yielded similar results but which could be analyzed using basic statistics instead of mixed models.</li>
<li>Generated new statistical results and graphs using the data.</li>
</ol>
