<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/"><strong>GitHub</strong></a> is an online platform for hosting and sharing code. More formally it is called a <strong>software repository</strong>. It is very popular with software developers, especially those creating <strong>open-source</strong> applications, and has also been adopted whole-heartedly by many data scientists and data analysts.</p>
<p>GitHub has many features and uses. One of the most basic ones is to use GitHub like Dropbox to backup copies of code. GitHub also can act like a kind of web server to host websites, online books, and provide access to open source software.</p>
<p>Many people working on R packages use GitHub to host their package while its being developed or expanded. When a package is finished, it often is then submitted to CRAN, and the version on GitHub is used as the <strong>development version</strong> where new features are developed and tested.</p>
<p>You can access packages on GitHub to get the newest version before something has been submitted to CRAN, or packages that haven’t or maybe will never end up on CRAN. A package I use for teaching is called called <strong>wildlifeR</strong> and holds datasets and some functions. In this short exercise we’ll</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Download a package from CRAN we need to interact with GitHub, and</li>
<li>Download my package wildlifeR from GitHub.</li>
</ol>
<p>We’ll also go to the wildlifeR website to learn more about the package.</p>

<h3>Functions &amp; Arguements</h3>
<p>The following functions and arguments will be used in this post:</p>
<p>tufte::margin_note(“speakR: In the line devtools::install_github, devtools is the package and install_github is the function contained in it.”)</p>
<ul>
<li>library()</li>
<li>devtools::install_github()</li>
<li>scatter.smooth()</li>
<li>$</li>

<h3>Packages</h3>
<p>The following packages will be used in this post:</p>

<h3>Potential hangups</h3>
<p>In this post we’ll use the “<strong>$</strong>” operator to tell the function scatter.smooth() what to plot, which is different than how ggpubr and ggplot2 work; sigh…</p>

<h2>Accessing GitHub using devtools</h2>
<p>The devtools package is used by many people who write R packages and includes a function for downloading <em>other</em> packages from GitHub.</p>
<p>tufte::margin_note(“devtools has a lot of dependencies so this might take a while”)</p>
<pre class="r"><code>install.packages(&quot;devtools&quot;, dependencies = TRUE)</code></pre>
<p>Once everything is downloaded, load devtools explicitly with library()</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(devtools)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Loading required package: usethis</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="downloading-the-wildlifer-package-with-install_github" class="section level2">
<h2>Downloading the wildlifeR package with install_github()</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/brouwern">My GitHub site</a> is at <a href="https://github.com/brouwern" class="uri">https://github.com/brouwern</a> and the code for <a href="https://github.com/brouwern/wildlifeR">wildlifeR</a> is at <a href="https://github.com/brouwern/wildlifeR" class="uri">https://github.com/brouwern/wildlifeR</a>. You can examine access the files from a web browser if you really want, but that would be kind of clumsy. Rather, we can download the package similar to as if it was on CRAN using install_github().</p>
<p>NOTE: You’ll probably see some red text and a LOT of black text as install_github() talks with GitHub. Totally normal.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>install_github(&quot;brouwern/wildlifeR&quot;)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Skipping install of &#39;wildlifeR&#39; from a github remote, the SHA1 (29f3ae31) has not changed since last install.
##   Use `force = TRUE` to force installation</code></pre>
<p>Now we can put it all explicitly into memory</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(wildlifeR)  </code></pre>
<div id="aside-accessing-data-from-wildlifer" class="section level3">
<h3>ASIDE: Accessing data from wildlifeR</h3>
<p>One of the datasets in wildlifeR is called “eggs.” It has data from a paper by Stoddard et al. (2017) in Science called [Avian egg shape: Form, function, and evolution.] (<a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/356/6344/1249" class="uri">http://science.sciencemag.org/content/356/6344/1249</a>). We can plot the relationship between egg asymmetry and “ellipticity” (how elliptical or oval-like it is) using the base R function scatter.smooth(), which draws a type of <strong>regression line</strong> through the data for us (Note that the syntax for scatter.smooth() is, sadly, different than plot(),ggpubr, and other plotting functions…).</p>
<pre class="r"><code># note how data is called
scatter.smooth(eggs$asymmetry, eggs$ellipticity)</code></pre>

<div id="the-wildlifer-packge-website" class="section level2">
<h2>The wildlifeR packge website</h2>
<p>Some packages have websites that summarize the package contents. This allows you to preview them without downloading them, and provides a cleaner interface to the help files and andy tutorials (“vignettes”) than what you get within R itself.</p>
<p>If you visit the website for <a href="https://brouwern.github.io/wildlifeR/">wildlifeR</a> at <a href="https://brouwern.github.io/wildlifeR/" class="uri">https://brouwern.github.io/wildlifeR/</a> you can find out information on each dataset and function under the “Reference” tab, and see how the datasets and functions are used under the “Articles” tab.</p>
</div>
<div id="summary" class="section level2">
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>That’s it. You now have the super power of being able to access any R package from GitHub. This is super useful if you need to try out the developement version of a package or use one that isn’t yet - or won’t be - released on CRAN. Sometimes researchers we’ll bundle up their analyses as an R package on post it to GitHub to allow others to easily explore and replicate their analyses.</p>
