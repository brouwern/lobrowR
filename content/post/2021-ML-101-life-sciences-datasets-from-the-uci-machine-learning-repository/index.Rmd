The [UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php) is a collection of over 500 datasets related to machine learning (ML).  There are a large number of entries related to the life sciences, including cancer medicine, bioinformatics, toxicology, and landcover classification.  I've organized some of them below.  I have not looked too deeply into anyone data set and so my classifications are all very preliminary.


## Bioinformatics

There are many applications of ML in genomics and bioinformatics.  While they often use standard ML techniques such as Support Vector Machines (SVL) or Neural Networks, the unique nature of DNA and protein sequence data requires specialized application of the methods.  I've therefore tried to divided the datasets into those that could be examine used general data analysis and ML techniques and software, and those that require more specialized analysis.

### Bioinformatics - General

[**Codon usage Data Set**](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Codon+usage)

**URL:** https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Codon+usage

**Abstract:** "DNA codon usage frequencies of a large sample of diverse biological organisms from different taxa"

Khomtchouk BB, Liang Y, Nonner WF: 'Codon usage bias levels predict taxonomic identity and genetic composition'. bioRxiv, 2020.

Nakamura Y, Gojobori T, Ikemura T: 'Codon usage tabulated from international DNA sequence databases: status for the year 2000'. Nucleic Acids Research, 2000, 28:292.

Column 1: Kingdom
Column 2: DNAtype
Column 3: SpeciesID
Column 4: Ncodons
Column 5: SpeciesName
Columns 6-69: codon (header: nucleotide bases; entries: frequency of usage (5 digit floating point number))

"The 'Kingdom' is a 3-letter code corresponding to `xxx' in the CUTG database name: 'arc'(archaea), 'bct'(bacteria), 'phg'(bacteriophage), 'plm' (plasmid), 'pln' (plant), 'inv' (invertebrate), 'vrt' (vertebrate), 'mam' (mammal), 'rod' (rodent), 'pri' (primate), and 'vrl'(virus) sequence entries. Note that the CUTG database does not contain 'arc' and 'plm' (these have been manually curated ourselves).

"The 'DNAtype' is denoted as an integer for the genomic composition in the species: 0-genomic, 1-mitochondrial, 2-chloroplast, 3-cyanelle, 4-plastid, 5-nucleomorph, 6-secondary_endosymbiont, 7-chromoplast, 8-leucoplast, 9-NA, 10-proplastid, 11-apicoplast, and 12-kinetoplast.

"The species identifier ('SpeciesID') is an integer, which uniquely indicates the entries of an organism. It is an accession identifier for each different species in the original CUTG database, followed by the first item listed in each genome.

"The number of codons (`Ncodons') is the algebraic sum of the numbers listed for the different codons in an entry of CUTG. Codon frequencies are normalized to the total codon count, hence the number of occurrences divided by 'Ncodons' is the codon frequencies listed in the data file.

"The species' name ('SpeciesName') is represented in strings purged of `comma' (which are now replaced by `space'). This is a descriptive label of the name of the species for data interpretations.

"Lastly, the codon frequencies ('codon') including 'UUU', 'UUA', 'UUG', 'CUU', etc., are recorded as floats (with decimals in 5 digits)."




[**Yeast Data Set**](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Yeast)

[Molecular Biology (Splice-junction Gene Sequences)](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Molecular+Biology+%28Splice-junction+Gene+Sequences%29)

**Abstract**: "Primate splice-junction gene sequences (DNA) with associated imperfect domain theory"

**Problem Description:**  "Splice junctions are points on a DNA sequence at which 'superfluous' DNA is removed during the process of protein creation in higher organisms. The problem posed in this dataset is to recognize, given a sequence of DNA, the boundaries between exons (the parts of the DNA sequence retained after splicing) and introns (the parts of the DNA sequence that are spliced out). This problem consists of two subtasks: recognizing exon/intron boundaries (referred to as EI sites), and recognizing intron/exon boundaries (IE sites). (In the biological community, IE borders are referred to a 'acceptors' while EI borders are referred to as 'donors'.)"

"This dataset has been developed to help evaluate a "hybrid" learning algorithm (KBANN) that uses examples to inductively refine preexisting knowledge."


**Attribute Information:**

1. One of {n ei ie}, indicating the class.
2. The instance name.
3-62. The remaining 60 fields are the sequence, starting at position -30 and ending at position +30. Each of these fields is almost always filled by one of {a, g, t, c}. Other characters indicate ambiguity among the standard characters...
