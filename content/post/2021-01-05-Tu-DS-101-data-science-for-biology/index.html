<blockquote>
<p>“Ecological questions and data are becoming increasingly complex and as a result we are seeing the development and proliferation of sophisticated statistical approaches in the ecological literature. … It is no longer sufficient to only ask ‘whether’ or ‘which’ experimental manipulations significantly deviate from null expectations. Instead, we are moving toward parameter estimation and asking ‘how much’ and in ‘what direction’ ecological processes are affected by different mechanisms” (Touchon &amp; McCoy 2016, Ecosphere, emphsis mine)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Spreadsheets are often used as the basis of data collection and education; but this is potentially problematic since spreadsheets typically do not promote good data management practices … The features of spreadsheets that make them desirable for the average researcher, such as extensibility, use of formatting for organization, embedding charts, make them undesirable for preparing data for long‐term archiving and reuse.” (Strasser &amp; Hampton 2012 Ecosphere)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Data analysis include “procedures for analyzing data, techniques for interpreting the results …, ways of planning the gathering of data to make its analysis easier, more precise or more accurate, and all the machinery and results of (mathematical) statistics which apply to analyzing data.” John Tukey, “The future of data analysis”, Annals of Mathematical Statistics, 1962.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>People argue about what data science is.</p>
<p>What Tukey calls “data analysis” is now termed “data science” by many.</p>
<p>Some define data science as closely allied with computer science and want its use most closely associated with things like “big data”, data mining, machine learning, and artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>Others, such as RStudio’s Hadley Wickham (creator of ggplot2, dplyr, and most of the infrasture of the tidyverse of R package) define it more broadly to involve <em>all</em> aspects of the life cycle of data. (Wickham also jokingly defines a data scientists as “A data scientist is a statistician who is wearing a bow tie”) <a href="https://twitter.com/hadleywickham/status/906146116412039169?lang=en" class="uri">https://twitter.com/hadleywickham/status/906146116412039169?lang=en</a>)</p>
